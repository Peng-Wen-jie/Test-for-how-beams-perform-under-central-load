								<p>Young’s modulus of elasticity plays an important role in engineering and material. It is a characteristic of the material which is not dependent on the stress or on the relative deformation. There are several ways to determine the modulus of elasticity—mechanical, acoustics, ultrasound, resonance and optics. Mechanical methods are best used to determine the elastic modulus of thin materials such as rods, wires, and fibres.

Ohtsuki defined a new method for measuring Young's modulus of flexible materials based on the large bending strain of a sample subjected to axial compression at two fixed ends. This method eliminates unnecessary loading nose effects common in three-point or four-point flexion. Two types of flexible materials (PVC: high polymer content sheet, SWPA: piano wire) have been tested, and the results show that the method is suitable for flexible materials, such as long thin fibre materials (fibreglass, carbon fibre, optical fibre, etc.) or thin sheets material.

Mirambelland Real studied the bending behaviour of stainless steel beams and calculated the maximum deflection under different load levels (especially under service conditions). The cross-section of the beam is square, rectangular and hollow. In the H-shaped section, the supporting beam bears a concentrated load at the mid-span, while the continuous beam bears two concentrated loads near the mid-span. Considering the change of the elastic modulus of the material with the length of the element and the possible redistribution of the internal force caused by the nonlinear effect of the material, the arrow obtained is very close to the value of the experimental strain.

J.E. Gordon mentioned that ‘the problem that supporting the roof is essentially similar in its nature to of making a bridge’ in his book Why Things Don't Fall Down. And he simplified the structure of the bridge to make it easier to understand. A cantilever is a beam one end which can be considered as being ‘built in’ to some rigid support. And a simply supported beam is one which rests freely on supports at both ends. We can imagine when two cantilevers connect back to back and upside down to form a whole, it is similar with the supported beam.
