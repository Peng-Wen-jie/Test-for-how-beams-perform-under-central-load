								<h2>Sources of errors</h2>
								<p>1. I found the cross-sectional area of the beams (aluminium and stainless steel rods) is not totally same all the time in anywhere of them for they are both made by machines, there might be faulty 
									workmanship.</p>
<p>2. The measuring equipment (e.g. Dial indicator, Vernier calliper) may have error. Because I found the number on the display varied from 0 to 2mm when I was calibrating them. </p>
<p>3. Swing of weights often affect accuracy of reading for they made the number varied. I may took some wrong record.</p>
<p>4. The heating temp. of rods and carbon content of stainless steel will affect the youngâ€™s modulus different from the given value.</p>
<p>5. Permanent plastic deformation could be caused if adding weight too quickly. It seemed happens in test 3.</p>
<p>6. The probe of the dial indicator is not at the centre of the beam for pothook of weights hinder in.</p>
<p>7. The component of the force may shift the fulcrum outward. So, when it loaded the same weight, there will be more deformation. In my view, that is one of the reasons why my experimental value higher than those theoretical.</p>
<p>8. The dial indicator has limit range which makes it unable to take more record.</p>
									
									<h2>Improvements</h2>
									<p>1. Select rods with higher standard to insure the value of every point are same.</p>
<p>2. Find ways for adding weight more properly.</p>
<p>3. Adding weights more carefully.</p>
<p>4. Fix the supports.</p>
<p>By reading some former report, I find a better device which can solve the problem about weight and the fulcrum. Showed in Fig 6, Fig 7 and Fig 8.</p>
